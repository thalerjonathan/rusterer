A small multi core game engine with a job system and custom renderer written in Rust. I have attempted to write a game engine in 2013 but back then I didn't know much. Since then I have completed my MSc and PhD and am a much more versatile computer scientist and have also studied and taught Game Engine Architecture. This is a project for me to: 1. get experience with Rust in a non-trivial software, 2. focus on multi core with a job and concurrent game object system, 3. write a tiled shading renderer in Vulkan to learn how to use Vulkan and the tiled shading concept.

- multi core 
- parallel job system
- concurrent game object system
- concurrent event and messaging system
- Vulkan renderer
- tiled shading architecture?
- rendering command buffer approach
- 3 stage frame pipeline (game logic -> renderingn logic -> GPU)
- culling
- animations
- asset import through assimp
- FMOD sound
- physics
- running on linux
